Filling-out a US employment agreement?
Daunted by the idea of having to fill-out a list of "prior inventions"?

We're here to help!

Run this simple script to list all your original (non-fork), public
repositories from GitHub, sorted in a reverse-chronological order of creation,
formatted as pipe-separated-values (name date description), like so:

    foo|2020-07-28|Makes very efficient foo sounds.
    bar|2010-10-31|Consumes all the chocolate bars.
    grandmas-computer-configs|2015-03-25|-

which then can be passed through `column` for nice alignment, like this

    foo                        2020-07-28  Makes very efficient foo sounds.
    bar                        2010-10-31  Consumes all the chocolate bars.
    grandmas-computer-configs  2015-03-25  -

Yes, many repos are silly, but so are many lawsuits...

Example usage
-------------

    ./github-inventions.rkt xandkar | column -ts\| > github-xandkar.txt
